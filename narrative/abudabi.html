<div class="contro">
<p class="white underline2">Why this call is unusual/controversial:</p>
<ul class="white"> 
    <li>He elected to restart the race at the end of that same lap, and not at the end of the following lap as the sporting regulations dictate.</li>
    <li>If he followed the rule book exactly, then the race would have ended with Hamilton crossing the finish line under the safety car. But that didn't happen. There is a clause that gives the Race Director the ability to overrule certain race rules which is the only reason this call still stands.</li>
    <li>This decision came after a "lobbying" call from Red Bull's team principle</li>
</ul>

    <div class="top-right">This means that Verstappen is now <span class="bold">half a second</span> behind Hamilton with only one lap left.</div>
    
</div>

<div class="expo">
    <p class="white">Meanwhile, Hamilton is at a large disadvantage because he's on much older tires while Verstappen had fresh ones.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="white">Mercedes tried to argue that this was against the rules, but to no avail.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="white">The race restarted, with one lap left, and Mercedes could do nothing but watch and hope Hamilton can hold onto his lead.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="white">It was a nail bitting final lap.</p>

<br>
<p class="white">This season of F1 was one of the closest in the sports history. With the incredible skill, fierce competition, and drama, it kept fans at the edge of their seats every weekend.</p>
<br>
<p class="white">Today, Max Verstappen has gone on to dominate the sport. He's won the 2022 Drivers championship, and will most likely win the 2023 one as well. And this year, he's broken the record for most wins in a single season, most consecutive wins, the most points won in a single season, highest win percentage, the most fastest laps in a season, and more! He has gotten first place in every race this year, but 3. He's is the most dominate driver in the sport right now, and possibly ever.</p> 
<br>
<p class="white">While Max might've taken the crown of the Unbeatable Driver from Lewis Hamilton, only time will tell who will take it from him.</p>
