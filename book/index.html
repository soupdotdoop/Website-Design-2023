    <h2 class="center2">My Thoughts:</h2>
    <div class="backgroundblue">
    <p>I absolutely love this book. The stories build on each other and share many thematic elements and parallels. Dick Grayson is one of my all-time favorite comic book characters so that definitely hooked me in at first. But everything in this book just works so well. If mysteries, thrillers, and or horror comics are your thing, then this is perfect. I have trouble explaining why this story is so good/I enjoy it so much, so I’ll try to break it down. 
    </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <h3 class="spoilersbelow backgroundred">1. The Writing</h3>
    <p>Scott Snyder is a very talented writer, and it’s amazing that this is his writing debut at DC Comics. Snyder is extremely talented at crafting atmosphere for his stories, and this is no different. The city of Gotham itself feels like a character on its own. We see how Gotham can corrupt heroes and create monsters.</p>
    <p>The mystery in Gotham and behind James Gordon Jr. slowly build and kept me on the edge of my seat. The book is divided between Dick Grayson (Batman) and Jim Gordon. With Dick initially battles horrific new villains that are popping up all over Gotham, and Gordon investigates his past and his son.</p>
    <p>Speaking of his son, I want to talk about James Gordon Jr.</p>  
    <br>
    <h3 class="spoilersbelow">––––SPOILERS BELOW!!––––</h3>
    <div class="spoilerbox">
        <div class="spoilerstext">
            <p>James Gordon is a wonderfully twisted character. While technically, his first appearance was as a baby in Batman Year One in 1987, this story creates a whole new persona for him. I think the decision to make his appearance completely ordinary was perfect. It makes him different from other Gotham villains while also heightening his creepiness. There would be no way to tell a normal person to this psychopath. </p>
        <p>He’s cunning, calculating, cold, and incredibly inteligent. As a reader, you are always wondering when he’s going to snap. And when he does snap, it still feels so shocking and horrific for how brutal and violent he truly is. </p>
        <p>The uncaring psychopathic James Jr. serves as a perfect foil for the compassionate and empathetic Dick Grayson. </p>
        </div>

<h3 class="spoilersbelow backgroundred">2. The Art</h3>
<div>
    <div class="artbox">
        <p>The art in the book is fantastic! My favorite artist on the book being Francavilla. His colors are just so striking and convey the mood so perfectly. He uses lots of oranges, blues, reds, and purples. The color choices are so bold really give this book an identity that sets it apart from other comics. I am conviced that Matt Reeves' red and black color scheme in The Batman was inspired by this story.</p>
        <p>I could explain why the art is so good, but I would rather just show you some of the panels:</p>

<h2>Why I love it</h2>
<p>1. The Writing</p>
<p>2. The Art</p>
<p>I absolutely love the art of this book. My favorite artist on the book being Fransico. His colors are just so striking and convey the mood so perfectly. He uses lots of oranges, blues, reds, and purples. The color choices really give this book an identity that sets it apart from other comics. I am conviced that Matt Reeves' red and black color scheme in The Batman was inspired by this story. </p>
<p>However, while I love Fransico, I think his art is strongest when it's not used in action scenes. That is where Franko comes in. Franko's art, I feel, does a great job of capturing these gritty and frantic action scnes. Both of these artists' styles are so different, but blend fairly well.</p>
