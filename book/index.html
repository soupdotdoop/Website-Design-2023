<h2>Why I love it</h2>
<p>1. The Writing</p>
<p>2. The Art</p>
<p>I absolutely love the art of this book. My favorite artist on the book being Fransico. His colors are just so striking and convey the mood so perfectly. He uses lots of oranges, blues, reds, and purples. The color choices really give this book an identity that sets it apart from other comics. I am conviced that Matt Reeves' red and black color scheme in The Batman was inspired by this story. </p>
<p>However, while I love Fransico, I think his art is strongest when it's not used in action scenes. That is where Franko comes in. Franko's art, I feel, does a great job of capturing these gritty and frantic action scnes. Both of these artists' styles are so different, but blend fairly well.</p>
