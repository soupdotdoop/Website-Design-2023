<h2 class="left">Response:</h2>
<p class="left">My perception of what a website is and can be has shifted after reading “My Website is a Shifting House Next to a River of Knowledge. What Could Yours Be?” by  Laurel Schwulst, “A Handmade Web,” by J.R. Carpenter, and “A Rant About ‘Technology’” by Ursula K. Le Guin.</p>
<p class="left">I think we like to put things on the internet because we want to share with eachother. A website is more than just a container of things. Schwulst describes creating a website as a kind of world-building and I like that idea. The best websites can feel like their own little world. Schwulst compares a website to a room, shelf, plant, garden, puddle, and even a thrown rock that’s “now falling deep into the ocean,” (70). But the desire for a website, I would like to add, could also be likened to a child scribbling their name on a school wall. A child doodles and puts their name on walls to leave their mark. Creating a website, to me, feels like leaving your mark on the internet. It is a little like saying “I was/am here.” </p>

        <p>I hope that websites will not become obsolete, but if I’m being honest, there’s a good chance they already are. J.R. Carpenter “A Handmade Web,” made me long for that decentralized and website focused internet that was before my time as well as the one I grew up with. The internet of fan websites made by dedicated hobbists. Most if not all of the websites from that time are gone (save for a few backups on the Waybackmachine).</p>
        <p>But even the websites made by huge corporations have diminished in charming quality. If you googled “Batman.com” in 2005, you would be brought to an atmospheric interactive website with videos, games, comics, and more. The whole website is suppossed to be like the batcave and it is great. Go to google today and type in “Batman.com” and it brings you to a bland page from DC’s website that has a few pictures of batman and a quick character bio. Barbie.com was the site to be when I was young, but now Barbie.com is just the Mattle online store. Gone are the flash games, the videos, and animated website elements. The same goes for hundreds of other websites. </p>

    <p class="final">These readings honestly made me sad because it made me realize what we have lost online. The internet has become so much more centralized than it used to be. There are really only a handful of sides that we go to frequently. And with the advent of the iPhone and apps, what we consider a website has shifted. Apps like snapchat or tiktok do not even really have a traditional website. Snapchat could only be accessed through its phone app until very recently. I still use social media everyday, including Snapchat and TikTok, but I worry the website is dying. The quirky charm of the internet is gone and in comes the stile centerized tech conglomerates.</p>
