        <p class="indent">I was really worried coming into this class when I read the syllabus and it said that we would be learning how to code in HTML and CSS because I thought we would be focusing more on the design aspects. However, when we actually started learning how to code I immediately loved it. It was completely surprising because I had never been interested in anything computer science related beforehand.</p>

        <p class="indent">I also felt that the readings were really insightful. I feel like my perceptions of internet spaces and development have changed as a result of this class. I didn’t really appreciate the importance of websites and website design until this class. Now, I can’t unsee it. When I use a website, I sometimes catch myself thinking about how they did that. I never thought about it before because the coding languages were so forgein and vague to me. But now, if I see a website do something cool (whether it’s minor or not), occasionally I’ll get the urge to use the “inspect” feature on Chrome, just to see what’s going on under the hood. I am nowhere near a pro at HTML or CSS (very much still a beginner), but having this understanding of it now lets me feel like I can understand how things on the internet work. </p>

<p class="textbox">I feel like I was able to make things that I was really proud of. I’ve put my favorite websites below. 
    I am most proud of my Formula 1 website in particular as I spent the most amount of time on it and feel like I learned a lot by making it. I spent many many hours trying to get certain aspects of the website to work, inputting data, adjusting elements, etc. And, while I am glad am done working on it, I still look back on the time spent fondly. It was an ambitious project, and I am proud of what I was able to create in the time allotted.

    <p><span class="bigquote">Thank you, Professor, for such an amazing class!</span> <br><br> The way you were able to explain complicated concepts in a way that I could understand, made me want to come to class everyweek (despite the early time slot). You were a perfect professor! </p>
