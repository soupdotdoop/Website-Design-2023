                <div class="floated hide-mobile"><i>“Apple’s <span class="emphasis">pursuit of cool</span> yielded an incredibly fragile, willfully esoteric website that’s good for no one.”</i></div>
                <p>I overall liked this reading and its approach to website design, but it also felt a little unfocused to me. A lot is being talked about, and I'm not sure if they all quite come together for me. The moment I started to feel lost is when Chimero started to discuss Hockney. When he started his arguments on “Edgelessness,” I started to understand it more, but I did not quite understand how it fit into his arguments on leaning into the natural structure of website tools. The edgelessness portion felt a little contradictory to his initial natural design arguments.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The reading had a mix of practical and more ideological/philosophical ideas. His arguments on “edgelessness” seemed like good practical advice to me. By not defining the edge, elements can appear more responsive.

                <br>
                <p>I thought her arguments on the naturality of website design to be really interesting. His main point being, website design is based on what HTML and CSS are inclined to do – “Many sites will share design solutions because we’re using the same materials” – and I liked that he encouraged this. Fighting against this is like fighting against nature. The example of a bear on a unicycle he used was perfect for understanding this.
